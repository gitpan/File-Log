File/Log version 1.3
====================

This is version 1.3 of File::Log, a module to allow simple logging
of data to a file.  It provides for control over the amount of data
written by defining a debug value (where higher values represent more
log detail.  There is also an exception method which is used to log
errors (which are printed with leading ** characters).

There are quite a few configuration flags to control how the application
logs data.  You can configure timestamps on the data and/or the log file.

You can configure File::Log to store any exceptions internally.  The
combined errors can then be extracted with a call to $log->getExpText()
which could be used at the end of your application to email to the
administrator
